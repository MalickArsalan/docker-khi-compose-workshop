# Exercise 1

In this very simple exercise we will do the docker Hello World using Docker Compose. We are looking to run the image `alpine:3.8` and run the command `echo "Hello World"`

There will only be one service in this setup.

When you run `docker-compose up` you will see Hello World printed by the container.
